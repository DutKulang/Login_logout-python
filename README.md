In this project i try to simulate login and loginout functionality using python and the hashlib library.

A new file called creditals.txt will be created to store user entered infor.

This project uses *no database* it uses python I/O functions to read and write to files.

I also use MD5 encryption.


# Future features

- replace MD5 with Sha256 for encryption
